    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      A very chocolatey, moist Chocolate Fudge Cake that is similar to chocolate
      mud cake, but not as dense. Made with both melted chocolate and cocoa, AND
      topped with chocolate ganache, this one is sure to satisfying your
      chocolate cravings! Super easy to make, very forgiving, no stand mixer or
      beater. Just one bowl and a wooden spoon!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Nonstick vegetable oil cooking spray</li>
      <li>3/4 c. butter</li>
      <li>3 large eggs</li>
      <li>1/2 c. sour cream</li>
      <li>2 tsp. pure vanilla extract</li>
      <li>2 c. all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 1/2 c. granulated sugar</li>
      <li>1/2 c. packed dark brown sugar</li>
      <li>3/4 c. Unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
      <li>1 1/2 tsp. baking soda</li>
      <li>1 tsp. baking powder</li>
      <li>1 tsp. kosher salt</li>
      <li>1 1/2 c. bittersweet or semisweet chocolate chips</li>
      <li>1 c. heavy cream</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 350° with the oven rack in the middle. Spray two 9"
        round cake pans with cook­ing spray and line the bottoms with parchment
        paper.
      </li>
      <li>
        For the cake: In a small saucepan over medium heat, combine butter and 1
        cup water and heat until the butter is melted. In a medium bowl, whisk
        together the eggs, sour cream and vanilla. In a large bowl (or the bowl
        of a stand mixer), whisk together flour, granulated sugar, brown sugar,
        cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder and salt. Add the butter
        mixture and use an electric mixer on low speed to mix until just
        combined. On medium speed, mix in the sour cream mixture.
      </li>
      <li>
        Dividing evenly, scrape the batter into the prepared pans. Bake for 30
        to 35 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cakes
        comes out with a few moist crumbs attached. Place the pans on a wire
        cooling rack and let cool for 25 minutes. Run a paring knife around the
        edge of each cake to loosen it from the pan, then invert the cakes onto
        the rack, remove the parchment, and let cool completely.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make the frosting: Put the chocolate chips in a medium bowl. In a small
        saucepan over medium heat, heat the cream until hot. Pour cream over
        chocolate and let stand for 1 minute. Now gently whisk until creamy and
        smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Scoop out 3/4 cup of the chocolate mixture into another bowl and set
        aside the remaining frosting for now. Let the 3/4 cup of the mixture
        cool, stirring occasionally, for about 1 hour, or until it’s spreadable,
        creamy, and holds its shape.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place one cake on a serving plate, bottom side up. Spread the top with
        frosting in an even layer all the way to the edge, then top with the
        other cake, bottom side up.
      </li>
      <li>
        Gently reheat the remaining frosting by filling a medium saucepan with 2
        inches of water and placing over medium heat. Let come to a low simmer.
        Place the bowl of frosting over the water (the bottom of the bowl should
        not touch the water). Stir until it is melted and pourable. Immediately
        pour the frosting over the top of the cake. With a metal spatula,
        quickly spread it to evenly cover the top and let the frosting drip down
        the sides. Once the frosting is set, slice and serve.
